This repo contains analysis for a dataset related to bank marketing at a Portugese banking institution.

Customer features including demographic information, bank usage, and marketing interactions are provided, as well as general economic indicators relevant to the bank's product. We conducted an analysis using several classifier models to determine which customers were likely to accept the bank's offer. 

Additional analysis is located in the Jupyter notebook which is part of this repo.
